## *AIM*

The main aim of this project is to get familiar with different languages and programming models and how they are fundamentally different from one another.
*****************************
### *General Concepts*

The following aspects of a language must be kept in mind while using it:

#### 1. The programming paradigm
   It refers to the way or style of writing programs. Some common programming paradigms are:
   Procedural (C), Object Oriented (Ruby, C++), Functional (Haskell), Logic (Prolog).

#### 2. Syntax
   Syntax of a programming language is like its spelling and grammar. It is a set of rules which define the combinations of symbols which will be considered as correctly       structured.

#### 3. Type System
   The type system is a set of rules which assign a property called "type" to various components of a program. Having a good type system can help to reduce bugs.</br>
   Main categories:</br>
   A. Strong vs Weak typing</br>
      The distinction is not strict. If typing rules are enforced more strictly, the typing is said to be strong and weak if otherwise. The terms are relative. E.g. Java is considered strong while Javascript is considered weak.</br></br>
   B. Static vs Dynamic typing</br>
      In static typing, the type is determined at compile time/time of writing the code. Examples include C, C++, Haskell, etc. In dynamic typing, type safety is verified at runtime. Examples of dynamically typed languages are Python and Ruby.</br></br>
   C. Manifest vs Inferred</br>
      In manifest typing, type has to be explicitly declared, e.g. as in C. While in inferred typing, the type is automatically detected e.g. as in Python.</br></br>
   D. Nominal vs Structural</br>
      Nominal typing means that two variables are type-compatible if and only if their declarations name the same type. For example, in C, two struct types with different names in the same translation unit are never considered compatible, even if they have identical field declarations. In structural type system, equivalence is determined only by the type's actual structure. Examples of languages following this are OCaml and Go.</br></br>
   E. Duck Typing</br>
      It is similar to, but different from structural typing. An object's suitability is determined by the presence of certain methods and properties, rather than the type of the object itself. That is, if we have different types which have the same method, we can write code agnostically.
